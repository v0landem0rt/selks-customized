# selks-customized
This is SELKS open software, customized for my project. 
Differences between original out of box SELKS and this project is russian kibana localisation and host mode in docker-compose network(this is for network acessing outside the internet). Its settings up like original SELKS(https://github.com/StamusNetworks/SELKS/tree/master/docker), there are no differences.
